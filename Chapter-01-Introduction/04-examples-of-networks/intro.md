## 🌐 Examples of Networks — Introduction (Beginner-Friendly)

The world of computer networking isn’t just one big network like the Internet.  
There are **many types of networks** out there — some huge, some tiny — each built for a specific purpose.

These networks differ in:
- Their **size** (like connecting 5 computers vs. millions),
- Their **goal** (communication, data sharing, voice calls, etc.),
- Their **technology** (cables, satellites, Wi-Fi, mobile towers, etc.).

To understand this variety, we'll explore a few important examples:

---

### 🔸 1. **The Internet**
- It’s the **most famous** and **widely used** network in the world.
- We’ll look at:
  - How it started and grew,
  - The technology that powers it,
  - How it connects **billions of devices** across the globe.

---

### 🔸 2. **The Mobile Phone Network**
- This is a **different type of network** from the Internet.
- It’s built for **voice communication**, SMS, and now mobile data (3G/4G/5G).
- It uses **cell towers** and **radio waves**, not fiber cables or Ethernet.

---

### 🔸 3. **Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi / IEEE 802.11)**
- This is the **network inside your home or office**.
- It connects your devices to the Internet **wirelessly**.
- The most common standard here is called **IEEE 802.11** — it's the tech behind Wi-Fi.

These examples will give you a **solid foundation** for understanding:
- How different networks are **designed**,
- What **problems** they solve,
- And what **technologies** they use to make communication happen.
