## 🌐 What is the Internet? — A Gentle Introduction

### ✅ Key Idea:
The Internet is not a single network — it's a **huge collection of many smaller networks** all connected together.

---

### 🧠 Some Things That Make the Internet Unique:

1. **Common Language (Protocols):**  
   All these different networks can talk to each other because they use **common rules**, called **protocols**.  
   (We’ll learn about these protocols later — like **TCP/IP**, which helps devices communicate.)

2. **Common Services:**  
   These networks provide shared services like **web browsing**, **email**, **file transfer**, **video calls**, and more.

3. **No Central Control:**  
   - The Internet is not owned or controlled by **one single person, company, or government**.  
   - It **grew over time** from many small projects and research networks coming together.  
   - This is different from many other systems that are usually **planned and centrally managed**.

### 🕰️ Why Study Its History?

To understand how the Internet became what it is today, it helps to **go back to the beginning**:
- How it **started**,
- Why it was created,
- And how it **grew into the global network** we use every day.

### 📚 Recommended Readings (Optional for Deep Dives):
- **John Naughton’s book (2000)** — Fun to read and full of historical insights.
- **Brian McCullough’s book (2018)** — A more modern take on the history.
- **Charles Severance (2015)** — Technical explanation of how the Internet works.

These books are mentioned if you ever want to go deep — but for now, we’ll keep things **simple and focused**.
