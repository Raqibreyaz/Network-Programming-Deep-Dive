### 🔹 **1. What Is Ubiquitous Computing?**
- Coined by **Mark Weiser (1991)**:  
  > Computers should become invisible and seamlessly integrated into everyday life.
- This means computing is **"everywhere"**—not just on your PC or phone.

### 🔹 **2. Smart Homes: Everyday Devices with Network Power**
Examples of IoT at home:
- **Security systems**: door/window sensors alert you or the police.
- **Energy sensors**: monitor and reduce power/water/gas usage.
- **Smart meters**: send readings to utility companies directly.
- **Smoke detectors**: contact the fire department, not just beep!
- **Smart fridges**: detect when milk is low and *order more automatically*.
- **Showers**: track your water usage, give visual feedback, and help reduce your water bill.

### 🔹 **3. Networked Consumer Devices**
Even **non-traditional devices** are getting smarter:
- **Cameras**: send photos wirelessly to displays or editors (used in live sports coverage).
- **Smart TVs**: stream and communicate using **power-line networks** (send data over your home's electrical wiring).
- **Refrigerators, washing machines, ovens**, etc. can now talk to the cloud.

### 🔹 **4. The Ongoing IoT Revolution**
- **As costs drop**, more sensors and devices will be connected.
- Soon, *every device* you buy could have:
  - A chip to connect to Wi-Fi or Bluetooth
  - Sensors to measure something (temperature, location, motion)
  - The ability to *send data* to apps, servers, or other devices.

### ⚡ **Why It Matters**
- Saves **time** and **money**
- Helps with **safety** and **efficiency**
- Gives more **control and data** to users
