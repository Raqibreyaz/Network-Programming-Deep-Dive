## üì± Why Mobile & Wireless Access Networks Matter

- **Mobile devices (phones, tablets, laptops)** are now more popular than desktops.
- Users want **Internet access everywhere**: at home, work, cafes, cars, airplanes, etc.
- **Wired connections** aren‚Äôt practical in moving vehicles or remote places, so **wireless** becomes essential.

## üåê Types of Wireless Networks

1. **Cellular Networks**  
   - Provided by telecom companies.
   - Cover wide areas (3G, 4G, 5G).
   - Support mobile calls, texting, and data usage.

2. **Wi-Fi Hotspots (802.11 networks)**  
   - Found in cafes, airports, hotels, etc.
   - Allow mobile devices to connect to the internet without cables.

## üß≥ Real-World Uses

- **Transport & Logistics**:  
  - Taxis, delivery vans, and repair workers stay connected.
  - Dispatching jobs wirelessly saves time and adds flexibility.

- **Ride-Sharing**:  
  - Uber/Lyft drivers use smartphones as dispatch tools.
  
- **Military Use**:  
  - They need portable networks for field operations (no reliance on local infrastructure).

## üì∂ Wireless ‚â† Mobile (Key Distinction)

| Wireless | Mobile | Example                                      |
|----------|--------|----------------------------------------------|
| No       | No     | Office desktop computers                     |
| No       | Yes    | Laptop plugged into a hotel Ethernet port    |
| Yes      | No     | Wireless in unwired buildings (e.g., homes)  |
| Yes      | Yes    | Inventory tracking with handheld devices     |

## üì≤ Smartphones and the Internet

- **Smartphones** merge phone and computer features.
- Can **auto-switch** between cellular and Wi-Fi networks.
- **Texting (SMS)** was once very profitable but now replaced by apps like:
  - WhatsApp
  - Facebook Messenger
  - Signal

## üó∫Ô∏è Location Awareness

- Devices use **GPS or Wi-Fi triangulation** to determine your location.
- Applications:
  - Navigation/maps
  - Local weather or restaurant searches
  - **Geo-tagging** (location-based photo/video metadata)

## üí∞ Mobile Commerce (m-commerce)

- Mobile phones are being used to:
  - Make payments (via SMS or NFC)
  - Replace credit cards in vending machines and stores
- **NFC** (Near Field Communication): enables phones to act like smartcards
- **Retailers benefit** by saving credit card fees.
- But **customers might use mobiles** to check competitors' prices in real-time.

## üß† Future Possibilities

- **Smaller Devices** = More Uses
  - Wireless **sensor networks** can collect real-world data.
  - Examples:
    - Cars uploading performance/location data.
    - **Zebras or birds** tracked using tiny wireless sensors.
    - **Wireless parking meters** can detect cars, accept payments, and alert officers.
