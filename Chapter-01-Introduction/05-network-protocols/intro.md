# üåê Network Protocols

## üìò Introduction

Computers and devices need rules to talk to each other across networks. These rules are called **network protocols**.

Think of protocols like the grammar and vocabulary of a language. Without them, communication would be full of confusion and errors.

This section is divided into four main parts:
1. **Design Goals of Network Protocols**
2. **The Concept of Layering**
3. **Connection-Oriented vs Connectionless Services**
4. **Service Primitives (Functions that help communication)**

## üéØ 1. Design Goals of Network Protocols

Before building any protocol, engineers ask:

### What should this protocol achieve?

Some important goals include:

| Goal                          | Meaning |
|------------------------------|---------|
| ‚úÖ **Correctness**           | No data is lost or corrupted during transmission. |
| ‚ö° **Efficiency**            | Use as little time, memory, and bandwidth as possible. |
| üîí **Security**              | Protect data from attackers and unauthorized access. |
| üîÅ **Robustness**            | Should work even if part of the system fails. |
| ‚öôÔ∏è **Flexibility**          | Should support various devices, apps, and networks. |
| üåç **Scalability**           | Should work for both small and huge networks. |
| üîÑ **Interoperability**     | Devices from different vendors should work together. |

In short, protocols should be **safe, fast, simple**, and **work on any system**.

## üß± 2. Layering: Organizing Complex Systems

### Why Layering?

Networking is **complex**. So we divide the work into **layers**, like in a cake üç∞ or an onion üßÖ.  
Each layer has a **specific job** and talks only to its neighboring layers.

### Popular Layer Models

| Model        | Layers         |
|--------------|----------------|
| **OSI Model**| 7 layers       |
| **TCP/IP**   | 4 or 5 layers  |

### Example: Sending a WhatsApp message

1. **App Layer** (WhatsApp): Prepares your message.
2. **Transport Layer**: Breaks it into pieces and adds numbering.
3. **Network Layer**: Adds destination IP address.
4. **Link Layer**: Adds MAC address and sends to the next device.

Each layer **wraps** the data with its own header ‚Üí this is called **encapsulation**.

## üîó 3. Connection-Oriented vs. Connectionless Services

This is like asking:  
**Do we call before we talk, or just send stuff and hope for the best?**

| Type                   | Connection-Oriented                           | Connectionless                              |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Example                | Phone call                                    | Postal letter                               |
| Setup Required?        | Yes ‚Äì a connection is built before sending    | No ‚Äì data is just sent                      |
| Reliable?              | Usually yes                                   | Not always                                  |
| Ordered Delivery?      | Yes                                           | Not guaranteed                              |
| Protocol Example       | TCP                                           | UDP                                         |

### Real Life Examples:
- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**: Like a phone call. You ‚Äúconnect‚Äù, then talk, then ‚Äúdisconnect‚Äù.
- **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**: Like a postcard. You send it and hope it arrives.

## üõ†Ô∏è 4. Service Primitives ‚Äì How Communication Happens

These are like **function calls** a program uses to talk over the network.

Let‚Äôs say you're writing a chat app. These are the common actions:

### For **Connection-Oriented Protocols (like TCP)**:

| Primitive         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| `LISTEN`          | Wait for incoming connection |
| `CONNECT`         | Try to connect to someone |
| `ACCEPT`          | Accept a connection request |
| `SEND`            | Send data |
| `RECEIVE`         | Receive data |
| `DISCONNECT`      | End the connection |

### For **Connectionless Protocols (like UDP)**:

| Primitive | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `SENDTO` | Send a message to an address |
| `RECVFROM` | Receive message from someone |

Think of these like **APIs or system calls** that your program uses to talk over the network.

## üîÑ Quick Recap

| Topic | Key Idea |
|-------|----------|
| **Design Goals** | What protocols should achieve (speed, safety, compatibility) |
| **Layering** | Breaking complex communication into smaller, organized layers |
| **Connection-Oriented** | Like a phone call ‚Äì reliable, ordered |
| **Connectionless** | Like a letter ‚Äì fast, no guarantee |
| **Service Primitives** | Functions used by programs to send/receive data |
