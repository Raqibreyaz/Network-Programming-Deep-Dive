# ðŸ§  Guided Transmission Media â€” Simple Digest

---

## âœ¨ Main Purpose of Physical Layer:
- **Move bits** (0s and 1s) **physically** from one machine to another.

Think: "Making 0s and 1s physically *travel* from *my laptop* to *the server*."

---

## âœ¨ What is Guided Transmission Media?

- **Guided** = *Signal follows a specific path.*  
- That path is a **physical wire or cable** (not floating in air like Wi-Fi).

Visual:  
âž” Cable = A "road" that the data car drives on.

## âœ¨ Common Types of Guided Media:

| Type | Examples |
|:----|:---------|
| **Copper Cable** | - Coaxial Cable<br>- Twisted Pair Cable |
| **Fiber Optics** | - Thin glass/plastic fibers carrying light signals |

---

## âœ¨ Key Trade-offs for Different Media:

Each physical cable has **pros and cons** based on:
- **Frequency** it can carry.
- **Bandwidth** (how much data it can carry at once).
- **Delay** (how long it takes signals to travel).
- **Cost** (money to install and maintain).
- **Ease of Installation/Maintenance** (how hard it is to lay and repair cables).

ðŸ§  Always think:  
> "If I use this cable, what do I gain? What do I lose?"

---

## âœ¨ What is Bandwidth?

- **Bandwidth** = **Carrying capacity** of a medium (how much data per second it can handle).
- Measured in:
  - **Hertz (Hz)** â€” cycles per second.
  - Sometimes MHz (million cycles) or GHz (billion cycles).
- Higher bandwidth âž” More bits can flow through per second.

(Imagine bandwidth like **the width of a highway**:  
Bigger road = More cars = More data.)

---

## âœ¨ Side Note: Why *Hertz*?

- Named after **Heinrich Hertz**, the German physicist who first proved the existence of electromagnetic waves.

# ðŸŽ¯ 20-second Summary
> **Guided transmission** uses real cables (like copper and fiber) to move bits.  
> Different cables have trade-offs like speed, cost, and reliability.  
> **Bandwidth** (measured in Hz) tells us how much data a cable can carry at once.

# âš¡ Bonus Brain Trigger  
While reading deeper into "Copper Cable" and "Fiber Optics", keep asking:  
> "Why would a company choose fiber over copper?"  
(You'll learn it's about bandwidth, distance, interference, etc.)
