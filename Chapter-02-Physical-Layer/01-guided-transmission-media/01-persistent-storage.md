# 🧠 Persistent Storage — Simple Digest

---

## ✨ What is Persistent Storage (for Data Transfer)?

- Instead of using internet or satellites, **you can just write data onto storage devices** (like tapes, hard disks, SSDs).
- Then **physically move** (carry/ship) them to the destination.
- Example storage devices:  
  ➔ Magnetic tapes, recordable DVDs, SSDs.

🛻 **Storage = Data container;  
Truck = Data carrier.**

---

## ✨ Why Use This Instead of a Network?

- **Surprisingly cheap** 🤑
- **Extremely high "bandwidth"** 🚀
- Perfect when:
  - You need to move **huge** amounts of data.
  - You want **low cost per bit** transferred.
  - You don't need "real-time" instant delivery.

---

## ✨ A Quick Calculation — Why It's Powerful:

- **One Ultrium tape** = ~30 TB (terabytes).
- **One box** (60cm × 60cm × 60cm) = ~1000 tapes.

🔵 Total in one box =  
  ➔ 30 TB × 1000 = **30,000 TB** = **30 Petabytes**.

✈ **Ship that box** anywhere in 24 hours by FedEx.

---

### ➔ Effective Bandwidth:
- 30 PB over 24 hours =  
  ➔ **> 70 Gbps** (Gigabits per second).

- If destination is just 1 hour away:  
  ➔ **> 1700 Gbps**.

📈 **No network** today (even fiber or satellites) can match that kind of raw bulk transfer speed!

---

## ✨ And the Cost?

- **Ultrium tape** ≈ $40 (bulk price).
- **10 reuses** → Cost per tape is spread out.
- **Shipping + tape cost** ≈ $5000 for **800 TB**.

💵 Shipping cost per **1 GB** = **~half a cent**.

🔴 ➔ Networks (internet, cloud) are *way* more expensive for that volume!

# 🛻 Funny Moral:
> **"Never underestimate the bandwidth of a station wagon full of tapes hurtling down the highway."**

Meaning:  
**Sometimes a physical truck is faster and cheaper than internet cables!** 🤣

# ✨ Bonus: Real-World Example (Amazon Snowmobile)

- Amazon created **"Snowmobile"** =  
  ➔ A *giant truck* filled with **storage disks**.
- Capacity = **100 PB** (100,000 TB!)
- How it works:
  1. Truck connects directly to company’s high-speed fiber.
  2. Downloads huge data centers into itself.
  3. Drives to Amazon’s data center.
  4. Uploads all data.

🏢 Used when companies move from their own servers to **AWS Cloud**.

---

# 🎯 20-second Summary
> Moving hard drives or tapes physically is *cheaper* and *faster* for **huge** data than even the best networks.  
> Companies like Amazon even have trucks (Snowmobile) just for this!

# ⚡ Tiny Thought to Keep in Mind
Whenever you hear "data transfer," don't just think about Wi-Fi, fiber, or satellites.  
**Sometimes trucks and boxes are the real network.** 📦🚚
